# Repository setup guides

This directory contains a collection of guides and tutorials on various aspects of setting up and maintaining software development repositories.

## Structure

The guides are organized into subdirectories based on their topic:

-   `ci_cd/`: Continuous integration and continuous deployment practices (e.g., [GitHub Actions basics](./ci_cd/github_actions_basics.md), [Automated testing](./ci_cd/automated_testing.md), [Automated releases](./ci_cd/releases.md)).
-   `version_control/`: Best practices for version control (e.g., [Semantic commits](./version_control/semantic_commits.md), branching strategies).
-   `virtual_environments/`: Managing project dependencies and virtual environments (e.g., [Poetry setup](./virtual_environments/poetry_setup.md)).

Feel free to contribute new guides or improve existing ones following the established structure.
