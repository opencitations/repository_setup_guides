## What you'll find here

This collection provides guides for setting up and maintaining Python development repositories. The guides cover automation, best practices, and integrated tooling.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Virtual environments" icon="puzzle">
    Set up projects with UV, a Python package manager that provides reproducible dependency resolution and Python version management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version control" icon="pencil">
    Use semantic commits with the Conventional Commits specification for readable history and automated versioning.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CI/CD automation" icon="rocket">
    Learn to automate testing, releases, and deployment with GitHub Actions. Includes matrix testing, semantic releases, and PyPI publishing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documentation" icon="open-book">
    Set up Starlight documentation sites with automated GitHub Pages deployment for technical documentation.
  </Card>

## Quick navigation

- **[UV setup](/repository_setup_guides/virtual_environments/uv_setup/)** - Complete UV guide from installation to publishing
- **[Semantic commits](/repository_setup_guides/version_control/semantic_commits/)** - Conventional Commits specification
- **[GitHub Actions basics](/repository_setup_guides/ci_cd/github_actions_basics/)** - Core concepts and workflow syntax
- **[Automated testing](/repository_setup_guides/ci_cd/automated_testing/)** - Set up pytest with UV in CI/CD
- **[Automated releases](/repository_setup_guides/ci_cd/releases/)** - Version bumping and publishing with semantic-release
- **[Starlight setup](/repository_setup_guides/documentation/starlight_setup/)** - Set up documentation sites with GitHub Pages deployment

## Why these tools?

The guides focus on tooling that supports reproducibility and automation:

- **UV**: Provides reproducible dependency resolution through lock files and manages Python versions alongside project dependencies
- **Semantic commits**: Enables automated versioning and changelog generation through structured commit messages
- **GitHub Actions**: Native CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub repositories
- **Starlight**: Documentation framework built on Astro with GitHub Pages integration

## Example repositories

These repositories apply principles discussed in the guides:

- [opencitations/oc_meta](https://github.com/opencitations/oc_meta)
- [opencitations/heritrace](https://github.com/opencitations/heritrace)
- [opencitations/time-agnostic-library](https://github.com/opencitations/time-agnostic-library)
