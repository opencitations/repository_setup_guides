## Quick navigation

- **[UV setup](/repository_setup_guides/virtual_environments/uv_setup/)** - Complete UV guide from installation to publishing
- **[Semantic commits](/repository_setup_guides/version_control/semantic_commits/)** - Conventional Commits specification
- **[GitHub Actions basics](/repository_setup_guides/ci_cd/github_actions_basics/)** - Core concepts and workflow syntax
- **[Automated testing](/repository_setup_guides/ci_cd/automated_testing/)** - Set up pytest with UV in CI/CD
- **[Automated releases](/repository_setup_guides/ci_cd/releases/)** - Version bumping and publishing with semantic-release

## Why these tools?

The guides focus on tooling that supports reproducibility and automation:

- **UV**: Provides reproducible dependency resolution through lock files and manages Python versions alongside project dependencies
- **Semantic commits**: Enables automated versioning and changelog generation through structured commit messages
- **GitHub Actions**: Native CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub repositories

All guides include real-world examples from the OpenCitations repositories.
